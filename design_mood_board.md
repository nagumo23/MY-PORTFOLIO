# Design Mood Board: Retro Y2K Grunge/Goth Portfolio

This mood board defines the visual language for the user's personal portfolio, blending the digital optimism of the **Retro Y2K** aesthetic with the darker, textured elements of **light Grunge/Goth**.

## 1. Core Aesthetic Concept
**Dark Cyber-Y2K:** A fusion of late 90s/early 2000s low-poly 3D, metallic sheen, and digital interface elements (Y2K) with distressed textures, dark backgrounds, and counter-culture iconography (Grunge/Goth). The overall feeling should be "fun" and rebellious, like a personal website hosted on a dark, forgotten corner of the early internet.

## 2. Color Palette
The palette will use a dark base with vibrant, contrasting accents to maintain the Y2K "fun" factor.

| Element | Color/Style | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Dark Charcoal / Black (`#111111` or `#000000`) | Goth/Grunge foundation. Provides high contrast. |
| **Primary Accent** | Electric Pink / Magenta (`#FF00FF`) | Classic Y2K pop, provides high energy and "fun." |
| **Secondary Accent** | Neon Green / Lime (`#00FF00`) | Digital, futuristic Y2K element. Used for links and hover states. |
| **Text** | Light Gray / Silver (`#CCCCCC`) | Metallic sheen feel, easy to read on a dark background. |
| **Borders/UI** | Distressed Silver / Metallic Blue (`#444466` or `#AAAAAA` with a texture) | Adds a "tech" and "metallic" feel, common in Y2K. |

## 3. Typography
A mix of digital-retro and distressed fonts.

*   **Headings:** A chunky, geometric, or bubble-style font (e.g., a stylized sans-serif or a pixel font for smaller headings) to capture the Y2K vibe.
*   **Body Text:** A clean, monospaced or simple sans-serif font for readability (e.g., `Courier New` or `Tahoma` fallback) to mimic early web text.

## 4. Visual Elements & Textures
These elements will be used for borders, backgrounds, and decorative dividers.

*   **Y2K:** Low-poly 3D shapes (e.g., stars, bubbles, spheres), metallic textures, scanlines, digital glitches, and chunky UI elements (buttons, scrollbars).
*   **Grunge/Goth:** Distressed textures, subtle noise/grain overlay on the background, chain-link borders, dark floral or tribal-like motifs as dividers, and sharp, angular frames.
*   **Fun/Mix:** Animated GIFs (low-res, simple loops), "Under Construction" banners, and intentionally clunky error messages for non-functional elements.

## 5. Layout and Structure
The structure will be simple and modular, reminiscent of early web pages, but responsive for modern devices.

*   **Header:** Simple, possibly centered, with a chunky text logo/name and navigation links in the accent colors.
*   **Sections:** Clearly defined boxes/modules with distressed borders, separating the content (About Me, My Work, etc.).
*   **Navigation:** Could be a simple, vertical list of links or a horizontal menu with a distinct background texture.
*   **Contact Form:** Designed with large, skeuomorphic input fields and a prominent "SUBMIT" button.

## 6. Content Mapping
| Section | Aesthetic Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **About Me** | Text with a stylized, perhaps slightly pixelated, portrait image. Use a dark background with neon-accented text boxes. |
| **My Work** | Media gallery using a grid of framed, distressed thumbnails. Hover state should involve a digital glitch or bright neon outline. |
| **Contact** | A large, chunky form with metallic or distressed borders. The form title should use the Y2K heading font. |
| **Skills** | Icons/text presented in a modular, grid-like fashion, possibly using a "loading bar" or "progress meter" visual for skill levels. |
